# Welcome! 
This page is for collecting and compiling resources about computational skills and best practices for the group. 

## Fundamental computational skills
 - navigating a terminal
	- basic bash skills
	- scripting
	- things to never ever do bc you could delete your entire OS
- using IDEs
- debugging
- standards and conventions (pep8, etc)
- conda & environment management
- version control: git
	- Branch/fork workflows
	- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
  - Atlassian tools: JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket & GitHub equivalents
- Software development life cycle/workflows
  - Task management/Kanban/Scrum/Agile-ish concepts
- pull requests and collaborative code contributing
	- "issues"/tickets and how to use those in branch/fork workflows 
	- usage for things like QA documentation practices (NQA-1)
	- Code reviews: like "peer review" process of papers, but for software
- Documentation: why you need to write it & how to write GOOD documentation
	- No, the code should not document itself (as your sole form of documentation)
	- Sphinx, Doxygen, etc
- software design concepts
	- Scoping work
	- Technical requirements
	- QA requirements, risks, failure modes
	- V&V
	- automated testing
- writing clean reusable code
- test-driven development
- is this the right tool for the problem at hand?
  - how do you assess that?
- parallelization: when it's good, when it's not

## Intermediate to advanced skills
- Object-oriented programming
- GPU vs MPI
- CUDA 101
- CMake
- Dependency management
- how to choose a language based on your applications
- data management
- memory management
- precautions re: using pre-existing tools 
	- and writing code that "works" but is wrong
	- or writing code that makes "pretty" pictures but is useless
- design patterns & antipatterns
- Using IDEs to debug on clusters with ssh/scp connections
- Debugging with GPUs
- single vs multidevice GPU
	- precautions
	- when it becomes slower than multithreaded CPUs (data transfers/IO)
-  profiles and formatting tools/linters
